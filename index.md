# Vatsal's First CS193 Homework

### What I like about CS193

- I like CS193 because it is a fun class that I can learn from and I can learn a lot from it.
- It will teach me about the tools developers use and how I can apply them to my own projects.
- It will help me learn how to collaborate with others and how to communicate effectively.
